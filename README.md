ðŸŒ¾ Predictive Agriculture: Crop Classification Based on Soil Metrics
Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying which soil feature (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, or pH level) is the most predictive for classifying crop types. Given a dataset of soil measurements and crop labels, a machine learning model is used to analyze and determine the best single feature for predicting the optimal crop for a particular soil condition.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Identify the single most important feature from the soil dataset that has the strongest predictive power for classifying crop types.
Evaluate and compare the predictive performance of each feature using a Logistic Regression model.
Output the best predictive feature along with its accuracy score.
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of several soil metrics and a target label indicating the crop type. The following features are included:

N: Nitrogen content ratio in the soil.
P: Phosphorus content ratio in the soil.
K: Potassium content ratio in the soil.
ph: pH value of the soil.
crop: The target label indicating the optimal crop for the given soil conditions.
Each row in the dataset represents a specific set of soil conditions, and the goal is to predict which crop is best suited for those conditions.

Approach
Data Preparation:

The dataset was loaded and inspected for any discrepancies in feature names.
The target variable (crop) was encoded as numerical values for use in the machine learning model.
Modeling:

A Logistic Regression model was trained separately on each feature (N, P, K, ph) to predict the crop type.
The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.
Evaluation:

The accuracy score for each feature was computed, and the feature with the highest accuracy was identified as the best predictor.
Results
The model was trained on four different features: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), and pH value (ph).
After evaluating the accuracy of each model, Potassium content (K) was found to be the most predictive feature for crop classification, with an accuracy of 29.54%.

Next Steps
While Potassium (K) showed the highest accuracy for crop prediction, further improvements could be made by:

Combining multiple features: Using all soil metrics (N, P, K, and ph) together could enhance model performance.
Experimenting with different models: More advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) could improve prediction accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Creating interaction terms between the soil features may reveal hidden patterns that improve predictive power.
Tools and Libraries
Pandas: For data loading and manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For model building, evaluation, and splitting the dataset.
Logistic Regression: For multi-class classification of crops.
How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pandas, scikit-learn).
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and evaluate the results.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning in agriculture by identifying the key soil feature (Potassium) that influences crop selection. While the initial accuracy is modest, this provides a foundation for further exploration and model improvement to help farmers make data-driven decisions on crop selection based on soil conditions.
